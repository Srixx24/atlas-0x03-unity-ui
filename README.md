This repository contains my very first full Unity game. It is a simple maze game with coins to collect, traps, and a finish line. I first experimented with Unity basics plus animation, asset utilization, audio, and particle system effects. It was all very new to me and a little overwhelming at first but I fell in love with this project and ended up delivering a product that was beyond my expectations. Even now, I'm still proud of this mini-game and what it means to my journey as a game developer.
